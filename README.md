# University Website Project

Introducing my latest project: **University Website** 

I recently had the pleasure of working on a project where I showcased my HTML and CSS skills to create an amazing university website. Using concepts like flexbox, media queries, hover effects, and the box model, I designed multiple pages that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional. 

## Project Highlights

###  Flexbox

A game-changer in web design, I've utilized the flexbox concept to create flexible and responsive layouts. This ensures that the website adapts beautifully to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience for all users. 

###  Media Queries

With the ever-increasing number of devices being used to access the web, it's crucial to make sure our website looks flawless on each one. By incorporating media queries, I've made sure that the website's design adapts seamlessly, allowing it to look stunning on both desktop and mobile devices. 

###  Hover Effects

Adding an extra touch of interactivity and engagement, I've implemented captivating hover effects. These effects enhance the user experience by providing subtle visual feedback when users interact with elements on the website. It's all about those little details that make a big impact! 

###  Box Model

The foundation of every web page, the box model plays a vital role in structuring and positioning elements. By utilizing this concept effectively, I've achieved consistent spacing and alignment throughout multiple pages of the website. It's all about creating that polished and professional look!
